# Tutorials

The examples in `examples/` cover the code. They are scripts with editable settings at the top: no command-line parsing, no
`main()`. Run them from the repository root. Each section says what it needs; the times are one laptop CPU core and include JAX
compilation. Examples that draw figures need the plot extra (`pip install ".[plot]"`); the VMEC ones need the vmex extra
(`pip install ".[vmex]"`, Python 3.11 or newer). The two commands `fax run` and `fax plot` are the package command line and run the
continuum and global-mode tasks only ({doc}`getting-started`).

## 1. A continuum, a global mode and a gradient on analytic geometry

`examples/quickstart.py` is listed in {doc}`getting-started` and needs no data. It builds the Könies et al. (2018) ITPA torus,
computes its continuum, finds the TAE (4.0610e5 rad/s) by shift-invert with its solver `Status`, and differentiates the TAE
frequency with respect to the mass density.

## 2. A continuum from a `boozmn` file

`examples/ctok_continuum.toml` is the STELLGAP CTOK test problem: a circular tokamak, `n = 2`, `m = 0..12`, deuterium at
10¹⁹ m⁻³.

```{literalinclude} ../examples/ctok_continuum.toml
```

```console
fax run examples/ctok_continuum.toml --plot      # about 4 s
```

```{image} _static/ctok_continuum.png
:alt: CTOK n = 2 shear-Alfvén continuum
:width: 60%
```

Each dot is one eigenvalue of the surface problem {eq}`continuum-galerkin` on one of the 99 half-mesh surfaces. Branches with
neighbouring `m` repel where they would cross, which opens the TAE gaps (`m, m + 1`) and, higher up, the EAE gaps. The same
continuum in Python:

```python
import fax

geo = fax.read_boozmn("tests/data/boozmn_ctok.nc")
f_hz = fax.continuum(geo, fax.mode_family(2, 12), fax.mass_density(1e19, 2.0))
center, width = fax.gaps(f_hz)  # widest gap on each surface, full width edge to edge
iota, w_hat = fax.gap_location(2, 3, 1)  # cylindrical (3,2)-(4,2) TAE crossing: iota, omega R / v_A
```

## 3. Global eigenmodes near a target frequency

`examples/ctok_eigenmodes.toml` sets `task = "eigenmodes"`, `target_khz = 384` and `count = 6`, so SOLVAX's block-tridiagonal
shift-invert returns the six eigenpairs of `F y = ω² G y` nearest 384 kHz.

```console
fax run examples/ctok_eigenmodes.toml --plot     # about 6 s
```

```{image} _static/ctok_modes.png
:alt: radial structure of the four lowest CTOK modes near 384 kHz
```

The modes found here (377.6, 378.6, 386.7, 388.1, 389.8, 390.9 kHz) sit inside the continuum, so most of them are
continuum-like: their harmonics peak where `ω` crosses a continuum branch (red lines in the figure on the {doc}`index`).
This case runs on the 99 half-mesh surfaces of the file; the AE3D comparison in {doc}`validation` uses AE3D's own full mesh, and
there the AE3D TAE at 337.9 kHz is **not** reproduced (a pinned block comparison traces it to three $\iota'$ terms of AE3D v31).

```python
modes = fax.eigenmodes(geo, fax.mode_family(2, 12), fax.mass_density(1e19, 2.0), target_hz=384e3, count=6, ntheta=32, nzeta=4)
modes.frequencies_hz, modes.structures.shape, modes.status.converged  # (6,), (6, 99, 13), True
```

Omit `target_hz` (or set `target_khz = 0`) for the dense solve of every mode; it is `O((N H)^3)` and only sensible for small
problems.

## 4. A stellarator from a VMEC input

`examples/qa_continuum.toml` solves the low-resolution precise-QA input (Landreman & Paul 2022) with VMEX at `ns = 16`, transforms
nine surfaces to Boozer coordinates with booz_xform_jax (`mboz = nboz = 8`) and computes the continuum of the `n = 0, ±2` family
(`Nfp = 2`, so these couple).

```console
fax run examples/qa_continuum.toml --plot        # about 1 min
```

```{image} _static/qa_continuum.png
:alt: precise-QA continuum for the n = 0, 2, -2 family
:width: 60%
```

`iota` falls from 0.422 to 0.417 across these surfaces. In Python the geometry step is
`fax.from_vmec_input(path, ns=16, mboz=8, nboz=8, surfaces=...)`; `fax.from_wout` does the same from a `wout` file or in-memory wout.

## 5. A gradient with respect to the plasma boundary

`examples/boundary_gradient.py` differentiates a smooth frequency-window objective, {func}`fax.window_risk`, of the three lowest
global frequencies of precise QA with respect to the boundary coefficients `rc01` (`RBC(n=1, m=0)`) and `zs01` (`ZBS(n=1, m=0)`).

```{literalinclude} ../examples/boundary_gradient.py
:language: python
```

```text
frequencies (kHz): [294.37821076 294.71453201 295.2077278 ]
risk = 7.1758e-02, d risk / d ('rc01', 'zs01') = [-0.62269764  0.54587794]
risk after a 1e-3 step along -grad: 7.0927e-02
```

{func}`fax.prepare_design` builds the static part (VMEX configuration, Boozer tables, FE nodes) once;
{func}`fax.design_frequencies` is then a traceable function of the boundary offsets, differentiated through the VMEX implicit
equilibrium ({ref}`vmex-gradients`) and first order only. It returns the solver `Status`, and the frequencies and their tangents are
NaN unless the solve converged. The run takes a few minutes on a CPU (it compiles the equilibrium adjoint). This is a tiny model
(three harmonics, 8 × 8 angles, 24 radial nodes), and its $n = 0$ modes are the continuum-like ones of section 7, so it demonstrates the
gradient chain, not a gap-mode objective; {doc}`validation` lists what the gradient is checked against and the open $m = 1$ gauge floor.

## 6. Fast-ion drive of the Könies ITPA TAE

`examples/koenies_tae_drive.py` (needs the plot extra) evaluates the perturbative growth rate {func}`fax.growth_rate` of a model
TAE (harmonics `m = 10, 11`, `n = 6`, Gaussian radial envelope centred on `q = 1.75`, `ω = 4.0e5` rad/s) on the Boozer form of the
ad hoc equilibrium ({func}`fax.circular_torus`), driven by the Maxwellian fast-ion profile of Könies et al. (2018), for
temperatures from 50 to 500 keV.

```{literalinclude} ../examples/koenies_tae_drive.py
:language: python
:start-at: from pathlib
```

```console
python examples/koenies_tae_drive.py             # about 10 s, writes koenies_tae_drive.png
```

```{image} _static/koenies_tae_drive.png
:alt: FAX passing-only growth rate vs fast-ion temperature, with the CAS3D-K ZOW points of Könies 2018
:width: 60%
```

The printed values at 100, 200, 300 and 400 keV are 4.26, 16.27, 32.48 and 64.02 ×10³ s⁻¹. The dots are the CAS3D-K (ZOW) curve of
Könies et al. (2018, fig. 1a): FAX is a constant 0.58–0.60 of it from 82 to 191 keV, plausibly the missing trapped share (the paper
does not say what the curve contains, so the content is unmatched and this is not a validation). The pooled ZLR band mixes codes
with different physics and is not used. FAX is zero-orbit-width, passing-only and has no damping; $\gamma/\omega$ is 4% at 200 keV
and 8% and 16% at 300 and 400 keV, where the frozen-mode picture fails ({doc}`validation`). Every argument of `growth_rate`
(density profile, temperature, `ω`, the mode, the geometry) is differentiable. The same call takes a stellarator
{class}`fax.Geometry` and a mode from {func}`fax.eigenmodes`; pass `helical` for the helical sidebands and a full `nzeta`.

## 7. Optimizing the Alfvén spectrum with quasisymmetry (exploratory)

`examples/optimize_alfven.py` (needs the vmex and plot extras) runs `scipy.optimize.least_squares` on VMEC boundary coefficients
with residual rows (aspect ratio, $\sqrt{f_{QS}}$, $\iota$ floor, Alfvén term), each scaled to about one at the start, and an exact
Jacobian: one VMEX + FAX forward pass and one adjoint per row ({ref}`continuum-objective`). Edit the settings and run it:

```{literalinclude} ../examples/optimize_alfven.py
:language: python
:start-at: CASE =
:end-at: OUT =
```

- **QH** (`CASE = "qh"`; Paul et al. 2025, eq. 7.1): 34 coefficients with $m \le 3$, $|n| \le 2$; rows $10(A/A_0 - 1)$,
  $0.1\sqrt{f_{QS}/f_{QS,0}}$, $10\sqrt{f_{\iota}}$ with $|\iota| \ge 1.03$, and $\sqrt{f_\mathrm{cont}/f_{\mathrm{cont},0}}$. It lowers
  Paul's geometric proxy $f_\mathrm{cont}$ by 26% (and narrows the high-frequency gaps by up to 29%) at QS ×4.3; no independent
  spectrum or transport check has been made, so this is a proxy reduction.
- **QA, gap modes** (`CASE = "qa"`, `MODES_KIND = "gap"`, about 8 min): two global modes pushed out of a window at fixed aspect ratio
  and QS (24 FE nodes). It takes the two $n = 1$ modes nearest 103 kHz ($m = 0$–5, $n \in \{-1, 1, 3\}$), which
  {func}`fax.classify_modes` finds to be isolated gap modes in the 96–142 kHz gap (102.1 and 103.9 kHz); the window is
  $[f_\mathrm{min} - s, f_\mathrm{max} + 20 s]$ with $s$ = 0.34% of the mean frequency and the Alfvén row is
  $30\sqrt{\text{window\_risk}}$. The script prints the classification of the selected modes before and after, and the first-order
  prediction $J\,\delta p$ against the re-solved change: a 4 kHz shift predicted to 0.05 kHz, inside a resolution budget of 0.13 kHz.
- **QA, continuum minima** (`MODES_KIND = "continuum"`): the three lowest $n = 0$ modes ($m = 1$–3), which the classifier finds to
  be **continuum-like**: each sits on the continuum minimum at its own radius, so moving them moves the branch minimum
  ($\propto |\iota m - n|$), not a mode of the geometry. Kept only as a test of the gradient chain; the earlier reading of this run
  as "modes leave the window" was a statement about that branch.
- **QA, drive** (`DRIVE = True`): the Alfvén row is $\text{drive\_risk}/\text{drive\_risk}_0$ of the growth rates of the four $n = 1$
  modes ($m = 0$–5, $n \in \{-1, 1, 3\}$) nearest 104 kHz, driven by 150 keV Maxwellian deuterons with
  $n_f = 10^{15}(1 - s)^2$ m⁻³ ({func}`fax.geometry_growth_rates`, {func}`fax.drive_risk`). The 4-coefficient run lowers
  $\gamma_\mathrm{max}$ by 4.4% (8500 to 8123 s⁻¹) at QS 1.1e-6 to 1.6e-6; that change is not bounded by an error budget, so it is
  not claimed as a reduction.

None of these runs shows that the optimized device has fewer Alfvén eigenmodes or lower fast-ion transport: the QA runs move
selected modes, the QH run a proxy, and the drive is passing-only. The script prints the objective history, aspect, $\iota$, QS,
$f_\mathrm{cont}$ and the largest gaps above the cut, and writes the figures below; {doc}`validation` lists the numbers.

## 8. The independent 3-D comparison (checkout and archive only)

`examples/knyazev_qa.py` rebuilds the offline fixture `tests/data/knyazev_qa.npz` from the Zenodo archive of Knyazev et al. (2026)
(DOI 10.5281/zenodo.21299907, 1.1 GB, CC-BY-4.0; the archive is data and nothing in it is executed) and reproduces the precise-QA
comparison of {doc}`validation` (about 15 minutes and 8 GB). Set the switches and the archive path at the top:

```{literalinclude} ../examples/knyazev_qa.py
:language: python
:start-at: ARCHIVE =
:end-at: REBUILD, STUDY
```

The continuum agrees with STELLGAP (3.0e-3 mean). The AE3D global mode (30.31 kHz) is not a FAX eigenmode (best overlap 0.18; its energy
in FAX's operator is 5.1% below its AE3D eigenvalue); the cause is unresolved. `benchmark.py` is described in {doc}`validation`.
